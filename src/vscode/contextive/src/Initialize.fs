# This initial definitions file illustrates the syntax of the file by providing definitions and examples of the terms
# used in schema of the definitions file.
#
# Hover over some of the defined words, such as `context`, `term`, `definition` and `example` to see Contextive in action.
#
# Update the yaml below to define your specific contexts and definitions, and feel free to use markdown in definitions and examples.
contexts:
  - terms:
    - name: context
      definition: A bounded set of definitions within which words have specific and singular meanings.
      examples:
        - In the _Sales_ context, the language focuses on activities associated with selling products.
        - Are you sure you're thinking of the definition from the right context?
    - name: term
      definition: A protected word in a given context.
      examples:
        - _Order_ is a term that is meaningful in the _Sales_ context.
        - What term should we use to describe what happens when a customer buys something from us?
    - name: definition
      definition: A short summary defining the meaning of a term in a context.
      examples:
        - "The definition of _Order_ in the _Sales_ context is: \"The set of _Items_ that are being sold as part of this _Order_\"."
        - Can you provide a definition of the term _Order_?
    - name: example
      definition: A sentence illustrating the correct usage of the term in the context.
      examples:
        - Can you give me an example of how to use the term _Order_ in this context?"""
