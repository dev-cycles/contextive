Contextive is a Visual Studio Code extension to assist developers in environments with a complex domain or project specific language, where words have a special meaning in the context of the project.

It should help new team members get up to speed more quickly in understanding domain-specific terms. By storing the glossary in your repository, and surfacing the definitions as you work on the code, it encourages the use of the domain-specific terms in your code, and regularly updating the definitions as the team's understanding evolves.

  * [Different terms relevant in different repositories](https://docs.contextive.tech/community/v/1.17.1/guides/setting-up-glossaries/#different-terms-relevant-in-different-repositories)
  * [Terms relevant only in a subfolder of the repository](https://docs.contextive.tech/community/v/1.17.1/guides/setting-up-glossaries/#terms-relevant-only-in-a-subfolder-of-the-repository)
  * [Multi-root workspaces](https://docs.contextive.tech/community/v/1.17.1/guides/setting-up-glossaries/#multi-root-workspaces)
* Works in all files (uses the `*` document selector)

### Coming Soon

* UI to edit/manage Contextive Glossary
* Internationalization support
* Support for multiple contexts in separate repositories
* Better support for key word identification in different languages (e.g. different syntax delimiters)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `contextive.path`: The path of the file that stores the Contextive glossary.  Default: `.contextive/definitions.yml`

## Known Issues

* The extension only activates on the presence of the `.contextive` folder in the workspace.  If the `contextive.path` setting has been updated, the `.contextive` folder may not exist.  (The extension will also activate on use of the `Contextive: Initialize Glossary File` command.)
