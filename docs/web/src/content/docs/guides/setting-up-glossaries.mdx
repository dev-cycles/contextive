Glossaries are files that contain lists of terms, their definitions and other attributes.

For Contextive to find your glossary file, it must match the pattern `*.glossary.yml`. You can name the prefix whatever you like, so `project.glossary.yml` and `module.glossary.yml` are both valid filenames, but `module-glossary.yml` is not.

## Glossary Location

The first thing to decide is how many of these files you need and where to put them.

:::tip
Terms in a glossary file are used by Contextive when working on any file in the same folder as the glossary or any of its child folders.

The following sections explore common patterns for where to place your glossary files.

### Terms useful in a whole repository

If the terms in a file are useful for all files in the repository, then you should put the glossary file in the root.

<FileTree>

- repository
  - projectName.glossary.yml a glossary relevant for the whole repository
  - README.md
  - frontend
    - components
      - SubmitOrder.ts
  - backend
    - domain
      - Order.cs

</FileTree>

In the example above, if `projectName.glossary.yml` contains a definition for the term `Order`, then that definition will be used when editing `README.md`, `frontend\Components\SubmitOrder.ts` and `backend\domain\Order.cs`.

### Different terms relevant in different repositories

This is fundamentally the same as the previous pattern, but is described to be explicit for teams who are using multiple repositories.

For this approach to work, each repository must deal with different domain concepts so that the terms useful in one repository are irrelevant in the others, and visa versa.

This pattern is particularly useful if each repository aligns with the concept of a Bounded Context from Domain-Driven Design.

<FileTree>

- shipping-repository
  - shipping.glossary.yml a glossary relevant only in the shipping repo
  - src
    - Order.cs
- ...
- payments-repository
  - payments.glossary.yml a glossary relevant only in the payments repo
  - src
    - Order.cs

</FileTree>

In this case, `shipping.glossary.yml` might define `Order` as `A set of parcels with a common delivery destination.`.  This definition will be shown when working on in the `shipping` repository.

`payments.glossary.yml` might define `Order` as `An amount to be charged to the customer`.  This definition will be shown when working in the `payments` repository.

### Terms are useful only in a subfolder of the repository

If the terms in a file are useful only in a subfolder, put the glossary file in the top-most folder that encompasses those relevant files.

For example, if you are building a 'modular monolith', you might have your modules in separate folders, in which case you should put definitions relevant to each module in that module's folder, like so:

<FileTree>

- repository
  - README.md
  - shipping
    - shipping.glossary.yml a glossary relevant only in the shipping repo
    - src
      - Order.cs
  - payments
    - payments.glossary.yml a glossary relevant only in the payments repo
    - src
      - Order.cs

</FileTree>

In this case, `shipping.glossary.yml` might define `Order` as `A set of parcels with a common delivery destination.`.  This definition will be shown when working on `\shipping\src\Order.cs`.

`payments.glossary.yml` might define `Order` as `An amount to be charged to the customer`.  This definition will be shown when working on `payments/src/Order.cs`.

This pattern is particularly useful if the modules in your modular monolith align with the concept of a Bounded Context from Domain-Driven Design.

### Terms are useful across multiple repositories

If you have multiple repositories that would benefit from access to the same terms, then it's recommended to define the terms in one repository and to construct a system for copying them into the other repositories.

:::tip[Coming Soon]
A forthcoming update to Contextive will let you 'import' your glossary from a remote URL, which will make this pattern much simpler. Stay tuned!

## Bounded Contexts

In Domain-Driven Design, a Bounded Context is a logical boundary around a model of some portion of the domain. It's quite common for different Bounded Contexts to evolve their own unique 'languages' or 'dialects'.

As described above, it's generally useful to have a separate glossary file per Bounded Context, whether you implement Bounded Contexts as separate repositories, or as folders within a repository.

However, for [legacy reasons](../configuration), glossary files support defining multiple contexts in the same file.

Ech context can be configured with a list path globs that can be used to define which paths should be considered when deciding which definitions to dplay
